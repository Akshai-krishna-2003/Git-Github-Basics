Learning git 

What is git?
It is a version control system and a code saving repository system. 
Git tracks all changes you make 
What how who and when everything is tracked.

Git vs github? 
Git -> This works on your local
Github (Remote repository) -> Central hub for collaborative works 

Architecture 
Local (Laptop) --> Remote (Cloud)

Working directory --> Staging Directory --> Save to local repository (Commit)

Repository: Place where your code lives with all its changes 

After saving to local repository (commit) -- Push --> Cloud repository 

Local repository -- Push --> Remote Repository
Remote repository -- Pull --> Local Repository

To create a git repo either
1. Make it locally 
2. Clone it from a remote repository

Concept of Branching 
Instead of doing changes in the main branch we make a separate branch 
with separate names 
Once we try and test all those features 
We just merge the changes to main branch 

So it is like 
Make a new branch --> Test your new features there 
Once it is perfected --> Merge it to main branch 

Merge --> Combining 2 branches into a single branch 

A branch will take exactly the same state as the previous branch when it is created 
So new branch takes the state of current working branch

Create a new branch and commit everything there 
Then if you switch to older branch you wont see anything 
See the thing is newer branch has newer commits and older branch has older commits
And older branch you can see in the same state as you left
