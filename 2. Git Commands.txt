Command 1: Initialize the repository: 
git init
-- Hidden folder named .git is created of tracking is done 

Command 2: Clone a repository: 
git clone <url> 
-- Getting remote repository to local storage

Command 3: To check status: 
git status
-- Git check on which files are changed 

Command 4: Moving changes to staging area:

git add --all (or) git add -a
-- Moving all files in the project to staging area

git add .
-- Moving all files to staging inside current working directory 
Eg. If you are in a root project and then you move to a folder using cd command and do git add .
Only changes in that directory will be staged

git add *
-- Only to stage new or modified files and not deleted ones 

git add filename.ext
-- Only to track 1 file changes

git add *.txt 
-- Only track added or modified .txt files to staging area

Command 5: Unstage changes from staging area:

git reset
-- Unstage changes from staging area

Command 6: Commiting into local repository:

git commit -m "message"
-- Commiting to local repo

Command 7: Adding configurations:

git config --global user.email "emailid"
-- Adding email address globally (since it uses a global flag)

git config --global user.name "username"
-- Adding email address globally (since it uses a global flag)

Note: If you use --local flag instead of global flag changes are done to a particular repo Only

Command 8: Undo last commit and bring to last commit

git reset HEAD~
-- Undo last commit and bring to last commit

Command 9: To delete a file and stage at the same time 

git rm "filename.ext"

git rm -f "filename.ext"
-- To forcefully delete a file

git rm --cached "filename.ext"
-- To keep the file physically intact but remove it from staging area

git rm -r "FOLDER"
-- To delete a folder and its contents recursively (-r)

Command 10: To get back deleted files and modified files 

git reset --hard

Command 11: To see entire commit history

git log

git log --oneline

Command 12: To see all branches inside the repo

git branch

Command 13: To create a new branch

git branch branch_name

Note: A branch will take exactly the same state as the previous branch when it is created 
So new branch takes the state of current working branch

Command 14: To switch branch 
git checkout branch_name

git checkout commit-id
-- To check what has happened in the given commit ID

Command 15: To merge a branch from another branch 
git merge branch_name -m "Merge message"

Note: If you want to merge branch A to branch B
You need to be in branch A and use the above command to merge branch B to branch A

Command 16: How to compare two commits

git diff commitid1 commitid2
-- Comparing commitid1 with reference to commitid2
Note: Newer commit comes first then comes the older commit and hence its how it is working

Command 17: Sending local changes to remote repository (push)

git push 
-- This pushes new changes to remote repo immediatley on current branch 

git push origin branch/branch_name
-- This pushes new branch to remote repo

Command 18: Bringing remote changes to local repository but not merging yet (fetch)

git fetch

Command 19: Fetching and merging at the same time so my working directory shows the changes 
immediately from the remote repository

git pull
-- git pull = git fetch + git merge

Command 20: If you have to come back to previous commit before doing a staging or commit use
Only changes till staging area can be reverted (Reverting changes before commit)

git restore filename.ext
- To restore only till a file 

git restore directory_name 
- To restore entire directory

git restore .
- To restore entire directory changes

git restore --staged filename/directory/.
-- To restore from staging area 

Command 21: Git stash 
-- It is used to store uncommitted changes somewhere in local and use it later 

git stash
-- This is the command

git stash pop 
-- Brings back the changes again
-- Once you make a pop the changes are never in your stash every again 

git stash apply 
-- To bring back changes but without popping it out of git stash 

git stash list
